# Airline Transportation Data Analysis Project

## Description
This project is a comprehensive data analysis of an airline transportation database using SQL. It covers various stages from data cleaning and consistency checks to advanced analysis like flight route efficiency, frequent flyer identification, and passenger income segmentation using ABC analysis. This project is part of the **Databases with SQL and Python** course on the [Hyperskill platform](https://hyperskill.org).

## Database Explanation

## Project Structure
The project is organized into six stages:
1. **Stage 1**: Date adjustment and synchronization.
2. **Stage 2**: Identifying frequent flyers.
3. **Stage 3**: Analyzing flight routes, flight durations, passengers, and income.
4. **Stage 4**: Comparing Boeing and Airbus flight durations.
5. **Stage 5**: Finding the top two routes with the longest durations for each airline company.
6. **Stage 6**: Segmenting passengers using ABC testing based on their contribution to income.

## SQL Queries
